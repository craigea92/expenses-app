# Expenses Tracker App

## Project Description

I have developed a user-friendly Expenses App using React. The app features reusable components for building an elegant user interface, and state management hooks to manage the app's data. Users can easily add new expenses, including details such as the expense name, date, and amount. 

During the development process, I encountered some challenges when passing state from child to parent components. However, with the help of the comprehensive documentation and available resources, I was able to resolve these issues by passing the state as a function from child to parent.

In the future, I plan to enhance the app's functionality by implementing additional features such as editing existing expenses, deleting expenses and a search function to quickly locate specific expenses.

## What is the Purpose of React Router?
React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page.

## What are Higher-Order Components?
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature. Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
